### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

I'm NDRAEY (En-dra-e), but my real name is Andrey. I'm Russian programmer.

I love to make some things like operating systems, bootloaders, some low-level things.

I prefer Python, C, Assembler programming languages

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Chronicles - LLVM IR code maker
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning System programming (C, C++, Assembler, Rust)
